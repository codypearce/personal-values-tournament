This activity is designed to help you identify the 8 to 10 values that are most important to you. On each screen, you will be shown two values, along with definitions for those values. Simply click the value that is most important to you. If you can't decide within a few seconds, click the "Both" option. Be careful, you can only click this option a limited number of times on each round, as indicated by the number in parentheses. Your progress through the round will be denoted by a progress bar, and when you reach the end of the round, the number of times you can click the "Both" option will change.

When you are finished, a list of your top values will be displayed. Take a screenshot or write down these values; they may be useful to you in later reflections.

There is no way for me to know your final list of values, so answer as honestly as possible.

When you are ready, enter your name below and click Start to begin.
