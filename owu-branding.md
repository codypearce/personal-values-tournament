OHIO WESLEYAN UNIVERSITY | Brand Toolkit20DESIGN ELEMENTS
Color palette Many schools in Ohio use a red and black or red and gray palette; we sought to differentiate Ohio Wesleyan by adding a new
slate of rich, energetic hues to match the dynamic and enterprising spirit of the OWU campus community.
Like the copy, this color scheme is utilized differently depending on the audience for the specific communication. For formal
usage, stick to PM 187, black, and PMS 485. As the target audience and messaging tends to a more relaxed tone, additional colors
are added to the mix. Beginning with the warmer PMS 151 and PMS 1235 , then adding in the cooler PMS 390, 3135, and 267.
The additional colors are meant to serve as bright canvases for messaging and imagery in telling the OWU story.

Fonts
Veneer (regular and italics) from Yellow Design Studio is a letterpress style font
family that’s bold and authentic with just a hint of attitude. It should be used for
short headlines on internal, recruitment, and other informal materials.
Kievit Slab Pro (book, book italics, bold, and bold italics) from FontFont is a
modern slab-serif font. It feels confident and assertive and should be used for
longer headlines and subheads or in conjunction with Veneer.
Kievit (regular, italics, bold, and bold italics), also from FontFont, is crisp and
modern in feel and reminiscent of the widely used, humanist sans-serif font, Gil
Sans. Kievit is easily readable even at small text size.
Alternate Gothic Two is a condensed gothic face available from Bitstream or
Linotype that may be used as an alternate headline font on more formal materials
where the irregularities of Veneer would seem discordant. It may also be used for
call-outs.
Freeland is a handwritten script by Trial By Cupcakes. This is the font used for
the “Oh-Woooo!” graphic. It packs a big character punch and should be used
infrequently – a little goes a long way.
